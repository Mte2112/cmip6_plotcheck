# CMIP6 Post-CMOR Plotting Program  
(cmor_plotcheck.py)  
Goal: After CMORizing E3 output, visualize all variables processed (where possible).
- Ensure that the data are of expected magnitude and distribution and that they are time-varying.
- Compare to available E2.X runs of similar configuration.
- Output key statistics that may give a snapshot overview of run.
- Make simple & efficient. Add complexity later if need be.  

To do:  
- Add command line args
- Subroutines, clean up dirty code
- Include more statistics, functionality to select
## More documentation coming soon...
